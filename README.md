# Grust: Green Serverless Data Processing

## Overview

Open-source project
Focus on environmentally friendly data processing
Utilizes Rust for resource efficiency
Targets both small and large files
Version: 0.01

## Initial Architecture

Target: AWS Lambda

## Core Functionality

Read CSV files
Select specific fields
Write to a specific endpoint

## Potential Future Features

Support for additional file formats (JSON, Parquet, etc.)
Data transformation capabilities
Integration with other cloud providers (Azure, GCP)
Benchmarking tools to measure resource usage and environmental impact
Optimization for different types of data processing tasks

## Environmental Considerations

* Measure and optimize energy consumption
  
* Implement efficient algorithms to reduce processing time
  
* Preference to use renewable energy sources for processing

## Development Roadmap

* Implement basic CSV processing Lambda function
* Add field selection functionality
* Implement flexible output options
* Develop benchmarking and monitoring tools
* Expand to support additional file formats and data sources
* Add data processing skills , initial skill is field selection
